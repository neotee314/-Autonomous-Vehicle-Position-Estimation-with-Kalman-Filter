""" An object of the Control class calculates the lateral and longitudinal control of the airsim car.

    The lateral control of the car can be calculated with the PID controller or with the Stanley controller.
    Both controllers calculate the steering control of the car.
    The longitudinal control is calculated with the PID controller.
    The longitudinal PID controller calculates the throttle or brake control of the car.
    With a Control object you can calculate a stop signal or a drive signal.
    When you want to calculate a drive signal the lateral controller tries to follow the path and 
    the longitudinal controller to reach the specified speed.
    When you want to calculate a stop signal the lateral controller tries to follow the path,
    but the longitudinal controller wants to stop the car as fast as possible.
